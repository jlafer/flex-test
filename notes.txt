Time-sucking Errors
- plugin-insights-testing would not start up properly; a JS console message states
  that "ke is not a constructor"; still havent figured out the cause but it was
  occurring in call to 'getSyncClientAndMap'; was happening when using deployed
  plugin and went away when i switched back to local dev server on port 3000
